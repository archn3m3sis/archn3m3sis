## A Little Bit About Me
*You Don't Know What You Don't Know Until You Do Know, & Only Then Do You Realize You Don't Really Know What You Thought You Knew...*

## Career Goals & Aspirations
---
> I used to be a slave to the hospitality industry, so the transition into IT for me was one of great excitement, especially when I had my daughter... I started from a very humble spot with Best Buy as a field services agent, and then moved onto an MSP, which quickly taught me what niche area of IT i DID NOT want to spend the rest of my life in... All the while my dream **was and still is** to join a high level Ethical Hacking team for a privately run company, or to be part of our more "shadowy" and "unknown" branches of government within the Cyber Security space...   

> All that being said, I've found that this tupe of job doesn't come easy, and so I have been progressively working on honing my skillset as I happily work within the field of Industrial Cyber Security for the Department Of Defense. If you are a fellow cyber security enthusiast please fo not hesitate to reach out with any insight, knowledge, or thoughts that you think I should take note of. I've always and will always try to maintain a student mentality no matter what level of the industry I end up reaching.

**My interests are as far and wide, as my toddler's attention span is short, but my current and primary interest are:**
- Ethical hacking, specifically hacking networks and web applications
- Python development
- Ruby development
- Security related application exploration
- Scripting for automation and blueteam / redteam operations

**My Certifications currently held are:**
- CompTIA Security+
- CompTIA Pentest+
- Fortigate Cybersecurity Operator
- Google IT Support Specialist
- Kaseya Certified Cybersecurity Technician

**I'm currently studying to take the:**
- CompTIA CySa+
- Cisco CCNA
- Python PCEP

**My Projects Will Most Often Be:**
- Ones that may bore you, as social development isn't really my thing, but I have decided to take a run at it, as I believe that getting more involved with the development aspects of cyber security, and with open source projects in general will only strengthen my skillset as I move forward with my career.
